# Android Workshop Series
Welcome to my very own workshop!! A series of tutorials to allow people to quickly understand and begin developing with the android sdk (in java). 

    Always a work in progress.... 

## Series 1 - Hello, Android
An absolute introduction in the android system, from the tools (logcat and DDMS) to developing layouts using basic xml. 

## Series 2 - Better UI
After the basics, some more advanced UI development features. Focused on _ActionBars_, _Fragements_ and _RelativeLayouts_. 

## Series 3 - Multitasking
Interacting with the system is important for any application and in this series we delve deeper into how applications listen and interact with events across the system. 

## Series 4 - Storing Data
Store and persist data, cache data and understand how data can be retreived. 


## Exercise Projects
